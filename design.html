							<hr />
							<p>It is no secret that we have amazingly low prices for designing and creating websites. The reason for this is that we pass on to you the savings we make by using top-quality templates that exist for free on the Internet, as a framework for your website. Actually, this is what many many web-design companies do, but they don't tell you and don't pass on the benefits they get from saving design time. There is still coding that needs to be done when using a template, but it is much less than creating a website without one.</p>

							<p>So basically we only want to charge you for the actual time we spend doing your website. We think that is fair, and means we can sleep well at night.</p>

						<div class="image fit">
							<img src="images/DomainName_Explained.jpg" alt="the parts of the domain name explained" />
						</div>
							<p>The picture above has 2 examples of a web address, and you may notice that the first part of both is exactly the same, with only the last part being different. Specifically, address 1 ends in "co.nz", and address 2 ends in ".com". It is important to note that these are seen by browsers as 2 different addresses and can point to two totally different and unrelated websites. If the owner of "yourname" company wanted both addresses to point to their website, then they have to purchase both addresses and point both of them to where their website is hosted (<a href="hosting.html">webhosting</a>). </p>
							
							<p>When choosing a domain name people usually focus on the hostname first. This hostname typically is the business name, or reflects the purpose behind the website. The hostname can be anything you desire, as long as it is available to purchase! </p>

							<p>The end part of your domain name is the top level domain (TLD), and can be country specific or generic. Some say that having the "nz" denotes that you are a local company, however many many international companies buy the local nz version for their hostname, so it isn't exactly accurate. The most common and "international" generic top level domain is certainly .com, however there are <a href="https://https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt">hundreds</a> of other generic TLDs you can choose. If you are looking to expand internationally then that is also another reason to consider going with .com. You can also specialize according to what your company does. For example, app software makers can use the TLD ".app". </p>

							<p>To avoid being swamped with choices we recommend chosing a TLD which is available for your preferred hostname, and if it happens that there is more than one TLD available (e.g. both .com and .co.nz are available) you can buy all, or choose the cheapest. We sell .com and some other TLDs at cost, that is, we don't charge any mark-up. We do this as our main business is designing websites. If you get hosting through us we'll even subsidize the cost of that domain name. You can search domain names and see prices <a href="https://wtf-websites.surebillingnetwork.com/domainshere" target="_blank">here</a>. Note that we are not a registered .co.nz seller, so if you want that you can easily find a seller through websearch. We recommend using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank">Duckduckgo</a> for searches as they do not curate or censor your websearch, do not sell your data, and do not keep your search records.</p>

							<p>We hope that this helps you in your purchase of a domain name. If anything is unclear or your have further questions please feel free to contact us. We answer your questions for free, with no obligation. We sincerely wish for your awesome success and are happy to help you along the path!</p>
