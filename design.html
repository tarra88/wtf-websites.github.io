							<hr />
							<p>It is no secret that we have amazingly low prices for designing and creating websites. The reason for this is that we pass on to you the savings we make by using top-quality templates that exist for free on the Internet, as a framework for your website. This is "off-the-shelf" + coding unique to your website. Actually, this is what many web-design companies do, but they don't tell you and don't pass on the benefits they get from saving design time!</p>

							<p>We only charge you for the actual time we spend doing your website. We think that is fair, and means we sleep well at night without doing mental gymnastics to justify our prices.</p>
						
							<h2>Wordpress vs Pure Code</h2>
							<p>Wordpress is an incredible free piece of software made to help non-coders develop and maintain websites. You can read our short description about it <a href="https://wtf-websites.com/hosting.html/#wordpress" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
							
							

							<p>So, one option to create a website is to choose a Wordpress Template as a base. Millions and millions of websites have been made by using a Wordpress template. Wordpress is the <a href="https://www.whoishostingthis.com/compare/wordpress/stats/" target="_blank">most popular</a> Content Management System (CMS) in the world. </p>

							<h4>Disadvantages of Wordpress</h4>
							<p>There are a couple of disadvantages with Wordpress. Firstly, it can be difficult to find truly "free" templates. You see, many companies make templates you pay for but they know that the majority of people want a free template if given that option. To capture this audience these unscrupulous companies will advertise either a free version of their paid template that is severely (you can only get the full version by paying for it); or they provide a "free download" of their paid version. In this latter case the search engine sends you to their website as it contains your chosen search word "free". Sure, you can freely download it, but you have to pay to access it! Rascals. To avoid this second type of issue a searcher would have to tell the search engine to ignore all results that have the term "free download". Of course hardly anyone does this. Frankly, we think this kind of behaviour is deceptive and reprehensible.</p>
							
							<p>If you purchase their paid template it can get worse. You will often find out after the fact that they did not let you buy the template outright, but instead "lease" it for an annual fee. If you don't continue to pay the annual fee they can disable the template. </p>

							<p>The second disadvantage of Wordpress is that the template is set in its structure and can be very difficult to make changes. That is, it does not 100% fit the wishes of the client, and so needs some changes to be made. Changes that require coding.</p>

							<h4>Advantages of Wordpress</h4>
							<p>Firstly, the good news is that there are still many amazing truly "free" templates that you can use. We have an extensive library of free templates for clients to view, and are happy to use any that the client likes. We pass on these savings to the client. </p>
							
							<p>Secondly, we can adjust the template for the client to give them the unique look and feel that they desire.</p>

							<p>Thirdly, once finished and published, the learning curve for making changes to website content or adding a new post is not difficult with Wordpress. We can teach your designated staff how to do this and even build in some protections so they can't 'break the site'. Of course, using your own staff to maintain the website content can bring you savings.</p>

							</div>

							<h4>Pure Coding</h4>
							<p>Another option to create a website is to build it from scratch. In these cases the client usually has a favourite site or two in mind as a reference, and would like us to build their website accordingly. The disadvantage of pure coding is that it costs more that using a Wordpress template as it takes much longer, and once finished, in our experience the client's staff will not have the expertise to maintain the site. However, the advantage of this approach is that the client is not limited by a pre-existing structure (like a Wordpress template) and so there is more flexibility to get exactly what they are looking for.</p>
