								<h2>More on the Domain Name</h2>

							</header>
							<hr />
							<p>In the process summary we discussed what a domain name is and why we need one. The domain name is made up of two pieces, as shown below: </p>
						<div class="image fit">
							<img src="images/DomainName_Explained.jpg" alt="the parts of the domain name explained" />
						</div>
							<p>The picture above has 2 examples of a web address, and you may notice that the first part of both is exactly the same, with only the last part being different. Specifically, address 1 ends in "co.nz", and address 2 ends in ".com". It is important to note that these are seen by browsers as 2 different addresses and can point to two totally different and unrelated websites. If the owner of "yourname" company wanted both addresses to point to their website, then they have to purchase both addresses and point both of them to where their website is hosted (<a href="hosting.html">webhosting</a>). </p>
							
							<p>When choosing a domain name people usually focus on the hostname first as this is most important. The hostname typically is the business name, or reflects the purpose behind the website. The hostname can be anything you desire, as long as it is available to purchase and doesn't contravene any rules. </p>

							<p>The end part of your domain name is the top level domain (TLD), and can be country specific or generic. Some say that having the "nz" denotes that you are a local company, however many international companies buy the local nz version for their hostname, so it isn't exactly accurate. The most common and "international" generic top level domain is certainly .com, however there are <a href="https://https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt">hundreds</a> of other generic TLDs you can choose (the graphic at the top shows a few). If you are looking to expand internationally then that is also another reason to consider going with .com. You can also specialize according to what your company does. For example, app software makers can use the TLD ".app". </p>

							<p>To avoid being swamped with choices we recommend chosing a TLD which is available for your preferred hostname, and if it happens that there is more than one TLD available (e.g. both .com and .co.nz are available) you can buy all, or choose the cheapest. We sell .com and some other TLDs at cost, that is, we don't charge any mark-up. We do this as our main business is designing websites. You can search domain names to see if they are available and also prices <a href="https://wtf-websites.surebillingnetwork.com/domains" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
								
							<p>Note that we are not a registered .co.nz seller, so if you want that TLD you can easily find a seller through websearch. We recommend using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank">Duckduckgo</a> for searches as they do not curate or censor your websearch, do not sell your data, and do not keep your search records.</p>

							<p>We hope that this helps you in your purchase of a domain name. If anything is unclear or your have further questions please feel free to contact us. We answer your questions for free, with no obligation to buy anything from us. We sincerely wish for your awesome success and are happy to help you along the path!</p>
