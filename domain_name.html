								<h2>What is a Domain Name?</h2>
								<p>What is a domain name and why do I need it?</p>
							</header>
							<hr />
							<p>Webhosting is the place where your website files reside. A good analogy of the relationship of your domain name and webhosting is that of someone's physical address and home. A visitor would go to the address in order to see the home. Accordingly a website requires 2 resources to properly function, being a domain name (address), and space to build and store your website files (webhosting). Then, when a person enters your website address (domain name) into a browser, behind the scenes the browser will go to that address and find your website files (where your website is "hosted"), and then show that file information (your website) in the person's browser. Webhosting is typically provided from a specialist data centre (see picture above) which maintains a pristine environment for each server (24/7 temperature controlled), as well as the best connection to the Internet and guaranteed uptime.</p>
							<p>Therefore, when planning a website there are 3 costs:</p>
                            <ol class="black-text">
                                <li>Domain name (website address) <b>WTF-Websites does not provide domain names - you need to get your domain name from a specialist provider. We can help point out some good ones and help you through the process.</b></li>
                                <li>Web hosting (somewhere to store your website files) <b>WTF Websites does not provide webhosting - you need to get your webhosting space from a specialist provider with a data centre. We can help point out some good ones and help you through the process.</b></li>
                                <li>Website design/creation (so that the files can be uploaded to your 'web hosting') <b>This is what we do!</b></li>
                            </ol>
                            <h3>Webhosting</h3>
                            <p>Physical homes have differing levels of utility prices. Perhaps where you live the electricity is cheaper than a suburb over. Maybe you have a fibre connection instead of ADSL broadband. Some homes only have single lane road access. There are similar constraints for webhosting. As utilities companies can differ in the prices they offer to consumers, you can find different pricing for the same item in webhosting. This can make it sooooo confusing for customers. We at WTF-Websites wish to make it as simple as possible for you. We have done the research on the competition out there and are confident that we can provide you with a recommendation that blows everyone else out of the water.</p>
                            <p>If you don't want to know the details of what is involved in webhosting and just want to know the choices and prices - go <a href="#">here</a>. Otherwise, please read on for a summary of the main items to be aware of when choosing webhosting.</p>
                            <ul class="black-text">
                                <li><b>Storage Space: </b>Just as houses come in different sizes, webhosting offers differing amounts of space for storing the files that make up the website. If you have a lot of pictures, videos etc. then you may need more space than someone with basically text and a few pictures. Ideally you just want to pay for what you need, and not be pushed into paying for something bigger than what you will use. We've seen cases where companies don't even tell the client how much space they are allocated, and just charge a high rate! Our distaste at this practice is one of the reasons why we created WTF-Websites.</li>
                                <li><b>Databases: </b>If your website will be offering services such as membership and/or an online shop then you'll need databases to hold and deliver this information. This requires a specialist software add-on. Also, if you want to use <a href="#wordpress">Wordpress</a> to run your website then that also requires a database at installation. Our cheapest offering already includes database software.</li>
                                <li><b>Email Accounts: </b>Webhosting provides the software and space to manage emails associated with your domain. For example if you own the domain "xyzcompany.com" and purchase webhosting to hold a website for xyzcompany.com, you should be able to generate however many email addresses you need, such as info@xyzcompany.com, accounts@xyzcompany.com, sales@xyzcompany.com etc. Be warned that some webhosting companies put a limit on the number of emails you can generate, e.g. "5", and we've even seen cases where they don't provide any email capability at all! We believe that if you pay for webhosting you should receive the ability to have unlimited email addresses associated with your domain, as you desire.</li>
								<li><b>Data Transfer: </b>When a person requests your website from their computer, their browser sends a message to the Internet to look for your website address and once found, reads the files you have hosted at that address and transfers the information back to your computer to be displayed on the browser. Usually this entire process only takes seconds. However, if you wish to display high quality videos or photos on your website then these are larger filesizes and therefore more data will be transfered from the webhost to your browser. This is data transfer. Your webhosting package will include a certain amount of data transfer allowance per month, and WTF-Websites will ensure that this amount is right for your requirements. </li>
								<li><b>SSL Certificate: </b>Have you ever been browsing the Internet and received the message "warning, the site you are about to visit is not secure..."? What this means is that the website does not have a SSL certificate and therefore the data going between you and the webhost server can easily be read by anyone. Any reputable website will ensure that all data to and from it will be encrypted, and this is achieved through having a SSL certificate. We've noticed that many competitors charge for adding a SSL certificate! There are excellent FREE trustworthy SSL certificates available and which only take a few clicks for anyone to install onto your website. Don't fall for anyone who tells you that the free one is "not safe" or "not as good". We stand by the integrity and quality of the SSL certificates available for free, and put our money where our mouth is by using one on this very website! </li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Location</h3>
							<p>Your webhosting provider can be located anywhere in the world. This is because the Internet these days is made of fibre optic and data is transmitted in pulses of light. These pulses travel at 99.7% of the speed of light! More important than location are factors such as: the connection of the data centre to the Internet; the security of the data centre where your website is hosted (i.e. access to vetted staff only); the up-time of the system (i.e. you don't want dropped connections = customers can't access your site); the ability to regularly back-up; and the environment of the centre (air-conditioned, regularly maintained, fire proof). Bigger, more established data centres typically have better facilities because they have been in the business so long and are dialled in to their customers' needs. </p>
							<p>Think of how Netflix servers are mostly in the US (certainly there are none in New Zealand), and yet the streaming service is fine. Same with the service from Amazon, or Apple, who's servers are also in the US. </p>
